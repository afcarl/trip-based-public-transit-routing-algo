------------------------------------------
 Python implementation of TBPTR algorithm
------------------------------------------

Implementation of the fast graph-based transit-routing algorithm from the
following papers:

- `Trip-Based Public Transit Routing (2015) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.07149>`_
- `Trip-Based Public Transit Routing Using Condensed Search Trees (2016) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01299>`_

Not focused on performance yet, more on readability and correctnes aspects
first, i.e. to have something working.

Under heavy development, not really usable yet.
