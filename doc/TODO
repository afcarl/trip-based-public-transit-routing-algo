- Implement calendar processing and checks during queries.

- Implement profile queries and algo optimizations from the arXiv:1607.01299v2
  paper.

- Add processing for transfers.txt and similar directional/pre-calculated
  "footpath"-like data, instead of generating it from stop locations.

- Some interactive querying interface for the thing would be nice to have - can
  be simple WebUI or something like ipynb.

- Implement more complex criterias for "stop change time", fares, priorities and
  similar things, which are currently either simplified to fixed values
  (e.g. TBRoutingEngine.dt_ch) or not considered at all.
