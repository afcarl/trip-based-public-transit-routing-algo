- Implement calendar processing and checks during queries.

- Implement profile queries optimization from the arXiv:1607.01299v2 paper.

- Some interactive querying interface for the thing would be nice to have - can
  be simple WebUI or something like ipynb.

- Implement more complex criterias for "stop change time", fares, priorities and
  similar things, which are currently either simplified to fixed values
  (e.g. TBRoutingEngine.dt_ch) or not considered at all.

- Fix some quirks with resulting journeys in a more clean fashion - prune extra
  footpaths, minimize journey-time, etc.

  See gtfs_shizuoka.test.J22209723-J2220952426.yaml and comments/algo-tweaks in
  engine.py for details.
