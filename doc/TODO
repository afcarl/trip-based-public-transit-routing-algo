- Proper --day and query-profile (and such) edt/ldt times processing.

  Currently these don't work correctly with --parse-days-pre > 0, as they're
  parsed naively, without adding dt_start offser.

- Parse gtfs frequences.txt, if available.

- Implement profile queries optimization from the arXiv:1607.01299v2 paper.

- Implement optimizations of shortest-path algo from arXiv:1607.01299v2 paper,
  based on "Multi-criteria Shortest Paths in Time-Dependent Train Networks" paper.

- Some interactive querying interface for the thing would be nice to have - can
  be simple WebUI or something like ipynb.
